This directory should contain ASL alphabet images.

For a complete implementation, you would need to add:
- asl_a.jpg through asl_z.jpg (26 images total)
- Each image should show the corresponding ASL hand sign
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels
- Format: JPG or PNG

For now, the application will show placeholder letters when images are not found.
